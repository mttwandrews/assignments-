#problem 1 chapter 3

Jason: I believe there is a bug in this program,
       what if the largest number is first input? or second input?
       Is the output as expected in both cases.

a= float(input("enter in the first number: "))
b= float(input("enter in the second number: "))
numbers= []
numbers.append(a)
numbers.append(b)

for i in numbers:
    if i == max(numbers):
        print("these are the same numbers")
    else:
        print("Largest number is:", max(numbers))
        
#problem 2 chapter 3
a= int(input("enter in the first number: "))
b= int(input("enter in the second number: "))

sum = 0
for i in range(a,b+1):
    sum = sum + i
print("your total is: ", sum)

#problem 3 chapter 3

Jason: You are producing multiple input() calls inside a for-loop,
       while workable, problem requires only one input. Then you
       have to split that input string for further processing.

list1 = [] 
for i in range(10): 
    num = int(input("Enter numbers: ")) 
    list1.append(num) 
list2 = []    
for i in list1:
    if i > 0:
        list2.append(i)
print(list2)

#problem 4 chapter 3
a = int(input("enter in the low number: "))
b = int(input("enter in the high number: "))
c = int(input("enter in the step value: "))
for i in range(a,b+1,c):
    print(i)
    
#problem 5 chapter 3

Jason: You should not be installing external libraries for these problems,
       try to complete without Numpy.

for i in range(1,50):
    list1 = i
    print(list1)
# i think im going to need to import numpy from what i gathered on the internet but everytime i do the kernal dies
